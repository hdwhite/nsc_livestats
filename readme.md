This is the code used for generating live stats for the [2023 PACE NSC](https://pace-nsc.org/live). It used a tweaked version of [MODAQ](https://github.com/hdwhite/MODAQ_NSC/tree/nsc2023) as QBJ input. This is rather janky in places, as a decent amount of this was written at the last second, and it's designed only to work with this one tournament. That being said, I do think there is potential if anyone wants to improve on this and perhaps make something that would more easily (and less buggily) work with other events.
